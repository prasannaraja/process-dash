# Practical Time-Capture Strategy  
## Measuring Day-to-Day Efficiency (WFH, Reality-Aware)

---

## 1. First: Reset the Goal (Very Important)

Your goal is **NOT**:
- perfect accounting
- minute-level accuracy
- proving innocence or guilt
- surveillance-grade tracking

Your goal **IS**:
> To roughly understand **where your time actually goes**,  
> why progress *feels* slow,  
> and which delays are **structural vs controllable**.

This distinction matters — otherwise tracking itself becomes stress.

---

## 2. The WFH Reality (Acknowledge the Truth)

Working from home introduces **hidden work** that traditional tracking ignores:

- Context switching (meetings ↔ coding ↔ family)
- Interrupt-driven fragmentation
- Emotional labor (conflict, tension, regulation)
- Cognitive recovery time
- Care responsibilities (child, household)

If you ignore these, you’ll always conclude:
> “I’m inefficient”  
when the truth is:
> “My day is fragmented.”

So we **model fragmentation**, not fight it.

---

## 3. The Right Unit of Measurement: “Intent Blocks”

Forget hours for a moment.

Track **Intent Blocks**:
> A contiguous period where you *intended* to do one thing.

An Intent Block can be:
- 12 minutes
- 40 minutes
- 2 hours

What matters:
- **What you intended**
- **What actually happened**

---

## 4. The Minimal Daily Capture Model (Low Friction)

You only capture **4 things** per block.

## **Intent Block**

  

• Intent (what I planned to do)

• Actual (what I mostly did)

• Duration (rough, rounded)

• Interruption flag (yes/no + reason)

That’s it.  
No micromanagement.

---

## 5. How to Capture During the Day (Practically)

### Step 1 — Start the Day with 3–5 Intents (Max)

At the start of the day (or night before):

Today’s Intents:

- Feature X: core logic
    
- Meeting: sprint sync
    
- Code review
    
- Admin / emails
    
- Family / care buffer

⚠️ **Never exceed 5** — more is fantasy.

---

### Step 2 — Passive Capture During the Day

You do **NOT** log continuously.

Instead:
- When you *switch intent*, you mentally mark it
- When you *stop working* or *get interrupted*, you note it

You only **write things down later**, in batches.

---

### Step 3 — End-of-Day 10-Minute Reflection

Once per day, capture:

Intent: Feature X

Actual: Feature X + debugging env issue

Duration: ~1h 10m

Interrupted: Yes (meeting spillover)

Repeat for 5–8 blocks total.

That’s enough data.

---

## 6. Categorize Delays (This Is the Gold)

For any interrupted block, tag **ONE** reason:

- `MEETING`
- `DEPENDENCY`
- `CONTEXT_SWITCH`
- `FAMILY`
- `EMOTIONAL_LOAD`
- `TECH_ISSUE`
- `UNPLANNED_REQUEST`

Do **not** overthink it.

Over time, patterns emerge.

---

## 7. What “Efficiency” Really Means Here

We redefine efficiency as:

Efficiency = Focused Intent Time / Available Cognitive Time

Not:
- hours worked
- tasks completed
- keyboard activity

Two people can both “work 8 hours”:
- one has 6h focus
- another has 2h focus

The system makes this visible **without blame**.

---

## 8. Weekly Insight (This Is Where Trust Is Rebuilt)

Once a week, answer **only these**:

1. Where did most of my time *actually* go?
2. What % of blocks were interrupted?
3. What interruptions repeat?
4. Which delays were outside my control?
5. What 1 thing would improve next week?

This turns:
- vague guilt  
into  
- concrete constraints

---

## 9. How This Helps With Trust (Manager / Team / Self)

This model allows you to say — **factually**:

> “Progress was slow because 40% of my intent blocks were fragmented by meetings and dependency waits.”

Not defensively.  
Not emotionally.  
Just structurally.

It also helps **you** stop internalizing blame.

---

## 10. What We Intentionally Do NOT Track

We explicitly avoid:
- minute-by-minute logging
- policing breaks
- productivity theater
- explaining every delay in real time

Because those destroy trust instead of building it.

---

## 11. The Key Mental Shift

Old mindset:
> “Why am I not faster?”

New mindset:
> “What is breaking my intent continuity?”

That single shift changes everything.
