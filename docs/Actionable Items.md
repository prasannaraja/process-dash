# Actionable Recommendations  

## Making Day-to-Day Time Use Visible (Without Burnout)

This section turns the previous model into **concrete, repeatable habits** you can start using immediately.

---

## 1. Use ONE Simple Daily Template (Non-Negotiable)

Create **one file per day** (or one section in a rolling file).

### 📄 `daily-log.md`

```md
# Date: YYYY-MM-DD

## Today’s Intents (max 5)
- [ ] Feature X – core logic
- [ ] Sprint sync
- [ ] Code review
- [ ] Admin / emails
- [ ] Family / care buffer

## Intent Blocks (captured end-of-day)

| Intent        | Actual Outcome                         | Duration | Interrupted | Reason |
|--------------|----------------------------------------|----------|-------------|--------|
| Feature X    | Env issue + partial implementation     | ~1h10m   | Yes         | TECH_ISSUE |
| Sprint sync  | Meeting + follow-ups                   | ~50m     | No          | — |
| Code review  | 2 PRs reviewed                         | ~40m     | Yes         | CONTEXT_SWITCH |
| Family care  | Child support                          | ~30m     | No          | — |

## Quick Reflection (5 mins)
- Biggest fragmenter today:
- What was outside my control:
- One thing to improve tomorrow:
```

**Why this works**

- Forces intent declaration
- Captures reality without judgment
- Takes <10 minutes/day

## **2. Round Time Aggressively (This Is Important)**

Use **coarse buckets only**:

- 15m
- 30m
- 45m
- 1h
- 1h30m

Never write:

- 37 minutes
- 1h 12m

Precision creates stress.

Patterns don’t need precision.

---

## **3. Protect ONE Daily Focus Block (Even If It’s Small)**

Recommendation:

- Pick **one 45–90 minute block**
- Declare it explicitly in your intents
- Treat interruption as _data_, not failure

Example

- Feature X – deep focus (protected)

If it gets broken:

✅ log it
❌ don’t self-blame

## **4. Standardize Interruption Reasons (Don’t Invent New Ones)**

Use ONLY these:

- MEETING
- DEPENDENCY
- CONTEXT_SWITCH
- FAMILY
- EMOTIONAL_LOAD
- TECH_ISSUE
- UNPLANNED_REQUEST
  
If something doesn’t fit, pick the **closest** one.

Consistency > accuracy.

## **5. Weekly Summary (This Is Where Insight Lives)**

Once per week, create:

```md
# Week: YYYY-WW

## High-Level Numbers (rough)
- Total intent blocks: 24
- Interrupted blocks: 11 (~45%)
- Focus blocks completed: 3

## Top Fragmenters
1. MEETING
2. CONTEXT_SWITCH
3. FAMILY

## What Was NOT a Performance Issue
- Dependency waits
- Meeting overload
- Environment instability
```

## One Structural Change for Next Week

- Example: Cluster meetings post-lunch

## **6. How to Use This in Conversations (Trust Repair)**

When asked about delays, say:

> “This week, ~45% of my focus blocks were fragmented by meetings and dependency waits. Actual coding time was about 6–7 focused hours.”

This is:

- factual
- non-defensive
- hard to dismiss
- emotionally neutral

You’re explaining **constraints**, not excuses.

---

## **7. What Success Looks Like (Realistic Metrics)**

Do NOT aim for:

- 8h focus/day
- zero interruptions

Aim for:

- 2–3 solid focus blocks/day
- decreasing _unplanned_ fragmentation
- clearer distinction between:
  - execution delay
  - structural delay

That’s real efficiency.

---

## **8. Psychological Safety Rule (Very Important)**

This data is:

- for **you first**
- for improvement, not justification
- not something you owe anyone in raw form

Share **summaries**, never raw logs.

---

## **9. Optional Upgrade (Only If/When Ready)**

Later, we can:

- auto-generate weekly summaries
- visualize interruption ratios
- correlate focus time with delivery
- integrate lightly with Planner-Hub

But **only after** this feels effortless.

---

## **10. Final Recommendation (The Anchor Rule)**

> **Track intent, not effort.**
> **Measure fragmentation, not hours.**
> **Improve structure, not yourself.**

If you want next:

- a **ready-to-copy folder structure**
- a **1-page executive summary template**
- or a **Planner-Hub–aligned schema**

say the word — we’ll keep it simple and humane.
